# üìä Calgary Crime Analysis with Power BI

## Overview

This project explores crime trends in Calgary from **2018 to 2023** using interactive dashboards built in **Power BI**. The goal is to provide insights into crime patterns across time, geography, and population, helping **residents**, **city planners**, and **law enforcement** make data-driven decisions.

## üîç Objectives

- Identify high-risk communities and crime-prone periods
- Analyze the relationship between population size and crime rate
- Support strategic planning and resource allocation for public safety

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle - Calgary Crime Statistics
- **Provider**: City of Calgary Open Data Portal
- **Timeframe**: 2018‚Äì2023
- **Records**: 66,349 unique entries

### Key Columns

- `Sector`: Geographic division (e.g., Northwest, Northeast)
- `Community Name`: Local area where crime occurred
- `Category`: Type of crime (e.g., Assault, Theft)
- `Crime Count`: Number of incidents
- `Resident Count`: Population of the community
- `Date`, `Year`, `Month`: Time of occurrence
- `Community Center Point`: Coordinates for mapping

## üìà Dashboards & Visuals

Built using **Power BI Desktop**, the dashboards include:

### Metrics & KPIs

- Total Crime Count
- Crime Rate per 1,000 Residents
- Year-over-Year Crime Change (%)
- Average Crime per Month
- Average Resident Count per Community
- Year-over-Year Population Change (%)

### Key Visual Insights

- **Seasonal Trends**: Crime spikes during summer months
- **Hotspots**: Northeast sector shows highest crime rates, especially for Theft and Assault
- **Population vs. Crime**: Smaller communities can have disproportionately high crime rates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Data Cleaning**: Inconsistent date formats and missing values required extensive preprocessing
- **Geographic Mapping**: Incomplete coordinate data complicated spatial analysis
- **Metric Calculation**: Creating accurate calculated columns for crime rates and population comparisons
- **Dashboard Design**: Balancing detail with clarity for user-friendly visuals
- **Outlier Interpretation**: Investigating anomalies in crime rates across communities
